# SQL Practice Portfolio

This repository contains my practice projects using the **ClassicModels** sample database.  
The goal is to showcase SQL skills such as querying, data manipulation, and analysis through practical exercises.

---

## Objectives
- Demonstrate ability to work with relational databases.
- Practice writing queries with `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `EXISTS`, and subqueries.
- Build a portfolio that reflects SQL problem-solving skills.

---

## Structure
- Each task is stored in a dedicated `.sql` file inside the `tasks/` folder.
- The file name describes the purpose of the query (e.g., `task1_customers_in_usa.sql`).
- Each file includes:
  - The SQL query.
  - A short explanation in comments.
